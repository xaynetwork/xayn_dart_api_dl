//! More convenient and safer bindings around `dart-api-dl-sys`.
//!
//! This crate provides wrappers for all functions in `dart_api_dl.h`
//! which can reasonably be used without also using deprecated APIs or
//! the embedding API. This means at least currently no API involving
//! a `Dart_Handle` is provided or should be used.
