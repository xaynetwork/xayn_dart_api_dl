/// match the major version of the `dart_api_dl.h` we build against.

///
/// The caller must also make sure that the function pointer slots are not longer
/// used after first this call succeeded and then the Dart VM stopped.

/// control at all over the dart VM stopping, nor reliable "just before stop"

// typed data and if blocking finalizers doesn't block the shutdown also doesn't work.
// Maybe with external native pointers (like added in dart 2.15) this will get a bit
// better.
